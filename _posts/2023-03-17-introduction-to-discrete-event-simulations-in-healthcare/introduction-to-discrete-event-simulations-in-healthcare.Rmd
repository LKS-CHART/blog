# Discrete Events Simulation at Providence Outpatient Care & Services Covid-19 Recovery scheduling


Discrete Events Simulations (DES) are a method of modeling the operation of real world systems.  DES does this by modeling a series of events in time.  Events are ordered by time of occurrence, and the DES system updates its state as it traverses through each event.  

This type of simulation is useful at modeling a system with many uncertain or probabalistic steps.  For example, in the Emergency Department, you won't know when your next patient will arrive and you won't know the condition this patient will arrive in.  In systems where there are a complex number of steps, many different resources, inputs and outputs, DES may be one of the only possible ways to model.

DES are built primarily for two purposes.  First, to assess our current system, and uncover bottlenecks.  And secondly, to assess how changes to our system will impact its performance.  We typically do this to test potential improvements to our system.  This could be a change in our process, additional resources, changes to inputs or outputs and changes in our schedules.  DES will allow us to measure metrics that are important to us in the current state and with changes to our system.

The underlying statsical theorems that support DES come from Queueing theory.  A classic example of queueing theory is the Call Center.  In a Call Center you have incoming calls, and you know roughly how many calls you can expect in any given time period, such as a Monday, or between 5-8pm on a Friday.  Therefore you know the frequency of calls and have some expectation on the variation of calls throughout the week.

However you do not know exactly when your next call will arrive (remember this is probabilistic or uncertain).  This is known as a Poisson arrival process, and is modeled as:

![Poisson Call Center Queue](./PoissonFormula.gif)

Lambda $\Lambda$ is the only parameter that Poisson depends on.  This is your arrival rate (on average.)  

Queueing theory works well for a simple queue like this, where you have a single entry point for your customers, a single type of service (answering the call) with some probabalistic length of time and one exit for your customer (end of call).

However with more complex system, such as an Emergency Department, we may have patients who arrive in multiple ways, have multiple possible treatments or interventions, and could have multiple exits (admission, discharge), the formulas for Queueing theory become impractical to model these systems.  That is when we need DES!

## Background

Simulation had long been used in manufacturing as there can be considerable variability in process outputs in a manufacturing line.  In addition to variability, having a bird's eye view of the entire process can allow us to easily assess bottlenecks in our system.  Bottlenecks could be caused by variability in our process outputs, overproduction, excess inventory, high down time or failures in machines, or a lack of staff or resources.  

We can then make assessments to changes in our system. Let's say for example we add an additional staff member at a point in our process. Does this improve our bottleneck? What if we replicate a few steps in our process and run parallel production? Will the cost to implement this strategy be outweighed by the benefits gained by a reduced bottleneck in this area? We can assess this in our simulation before trying it in our real world system.

In addition to manufacturing, DES can be used in call centers, retail stores, warehouses, airports, EMS services and increasingly DES is used to improve healthcare systems.

In each of these cases, DES is commonly used to evaluate capital investment decisions, staffing or scheduling changes, to evaluate process efficiencies, and even to predict bottlenecks in live systems.

Commonly in healthcare, DES is used to evaluate Emergency Departments, Operating Room Suites, Intensive Care Units, and Inpatient and Outpatient units.  The objectives of DES in Healthcare is overwhelmingly to evaluate the effects of operational changes followed by staff and patient scheduling.

At Unity Health Toronto we have used DES to evaluate changes to the physical layout in the Emergency Department (ED), assess changes to physician scheduling in the ED and most recently, assess patient appointment scheduling for outpatient services.


## DES software

There are many available software applications that can build DES models. Some provide an installer and can be used on a windows PC ([ARENA](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/products/software/arena-simulation.html), [Anylogic](https://www.anylogic.com/), [FlexSim](https://www.flexsim.com/), [Simul8](https://www.simul8.com/), etc). This is great for use in 1 time simulations when you will infrequently reassess your system.

We also have DES software that can be hosted remotely and can accept simulations as jobs ([Simul8](https://www.simul8.com/) has this feature).  This type of software can be useful when you want to run a simulation more frequently, perhaps even live to predict possible incoming bottlenecks. At Unity Health we have used Simul8 in the past for one time scheduling and capital allocation decisions.


There are also many open source DES packages now available.  Examples include [DESMO-J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DESMO-J), which is avaialble in Java, [Facsimile](https://index.scala-lang.org/facsimile/facsimile), in Scala, and [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), avaialble in Python.

For our project, we wanted to host an application where the user could enter in patient schedules and run the simulation remotely, on demand.  We chose SimPy to accomplish this.


## An Example of DES in the Real World: Providence Outpatient DES Project

Providence Healthcare (Part of Unity Health Toronto) was experiencing challenges scheduling outpatient appointments with the onset of the second wave of the Covid-19 Pandemic in 2021.  Providence approached us to model the outpatient services using DES.  We modeled the clinic in its current state and explored alternative appointment schedules to increase the number of patients flowing through outpatient services while maintaining social distancing practices.

Outpatient Services consists of multiple clinics providing medical appointments.  Each patient arrives, registers, and wait for the appointment in the waiting areas or vehicle.  They will then be escorted to clinical waiting areas or directed into a room.  After the appointment, they may continue to wait in the clinical waiting areas for follow-ups or leave the hospital.  During this process, there may be congestion resulting from a combination of patient behaviors, system resource and capacity (early-arrival of wheel-trans patients, max room capacity, lack of therapists); A smooth outpatient process is important for the hospital system to run efficiently for optimal patient care and quality of service.

Under COVID regulations, all individuals are required to maintain social distancing between each other.  To minimize unnecessary contacts, the Outpatient Service Department needs to control the maximum number of patients in each area of the department.  
Planning to re-open more outpatient services (and to reduce the backlog created by shutdowns during the first two waves of the pandemic), the Outpatient Service Department modeled new schedules by adding additional appointments with a combination of more staffing, longer hours, more patients and additional working days.


The solution that was developed for the Providence Healthcare Outpatient Service Department consists of two parts:

1) A simulation model that recreate the physical space capacity and analyze the system & process performance

2) Designing a web user interface that requires users to input key features of the simulation for testing different scenarios. In addition, the model would output key performance indicators to help access the performance of the proposed plans/system. 

The primary input that our user can manipulate to test out scenarios is the appointment schedule.  This appointment schedule includes a breakdown of the types and quantities of appointments that would be seen in Outpatient Services by the day of the week (Mon, Tue, Wed..).


The simulation model consists of three main parts:

- A defined object class called “Patient” with all necessary attributes and pre-defined calculation functions for results and outputs. Attributes include but not limit to:  appointment type, appointment clinic, and probability of the patient needing wheel chair transportation from his/her home.

- The second part consists of logging, status update, capacity checking and calculation functions for the simulation process. Detailed information of patient arrivals are calculated and recorded through these supporting functions.

- The last part is the simulation model function, where it reads in user defined clinics’ capacity, registration time, and an appointment schedule from an inputted excel file. The model then reads the patient schedules and generates patients based on their scheduled appointment time. 


All of our performance metrics (wait time, current number in system) are recorded through a trial of runs and outputted to the user. Utilization plots for clinics and service providers are also plotted. 

One limitation in our DES is the service time for each appointment.  We simplified the length of time a patient may spend at an appointment by ignoring some of the variabilities in process times due to the lack of data. Instead of fitting a time distribution, we had to use a more deterministic approach by assuming a static service time for all the servicing times involved in the model. However, once enough data is collected, those distributions can be obtained and the model can use a variable service time.
