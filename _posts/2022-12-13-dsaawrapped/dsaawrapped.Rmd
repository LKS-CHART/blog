The end of the year is a time for reflection, reminiscing, and sharing screenshots of our Spotify Wrapped. For those who are unfamiliar, Spotify Wrapped is a yearly marketing campaign by Spotify, where they compile streaming data and create a personalized graphic for each user. ^[We surveyed the members on DSAA and found that the most listened music genre is: ???] 

In the spirit of data, end-of-year reflections, and colorful infographics, we thought it would be fun to create our very own DSAA wrapped!
