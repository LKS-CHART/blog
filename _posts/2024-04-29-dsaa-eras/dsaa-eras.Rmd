## The Big Question

We often get asked variations of the following question:

> How do you [do / manage / deploy / monitor] data science in [a hospital / your hospital / a hospital network / healthcare] in a team of [5 / 15 / 30]?

It's always difficult to provide an answer since our process has changed a lot over time. This series of blog posts attempts to answer the question(s). 

Our team has evolved, gone through different milestones and big changes. Our processes and approaches to project management have changed accordingly.

For each "era", we describe our approach to data science. 
- The posts are meant to be high-level.
- Who are these posts for: anyone who does data science in a team, whether you're a data scientist, a project manager, a data engineer, etc.
- There's no right or wrong answer. What worked for us may not work for you.


## The Eras

Era 1: The Enterprise Data Warehouse
a.k.a. the one that lead to us building the [ED forecasting tool](link to tool or paper or blog)

- Data: We have it, thanks to our EDW! It updates daily.
- The team: At this point, we are a team of mostly data scientists, each with different areas of expertise.
- Project management: Mostly project-based with bi-weekly project meetings with stakeholders.
- Infrastructure: We have a separate server for model development. This server is managed by data scientists.

Era 2: Building out our data engineering and sysadmin team
a.k.a. the one that allowed us to deploy [CHARTwatch](link to tool/paper/blog/article)

- Data: The EDW is only updated once a day... but we want more recent data. We hired data engineers that can build pipelines that pull directly from source systems.
- The team: We focus hiring efforts on the data and sysadmin side of things.
- Project management: As our projects list grows, we try a sprint-like approach. Also, we're constantly experimenting with various processes. Our quarterly _sprint week_ is a great time to try out something new.
- Infrastructure: We get a new server for production while still maintaining the previous development server. We keep those environments separate.

Era 3: Building out our product development team and focusing on even more real-time data
a.k.a. the one that allowed us to deploy [Ops Centre](link)

- Data: Data Virtuality gives us real time data without us having to disturb the source systems.
- The team: Lots of people... we split off into the following sub-groups: Advanced Analytics, Data Integration and Governance, Product Development, Project Management.
- Project management: A _loooot_ of changes. We introduce product families. We have deployed solutions that need to be available 24/7... which means we need to start thinking about _downtime protocols_. There's a mix of Agile and waterfall? Weâ€™re still figuring this out.
- Infrastructure: Data Virtuality is a game-changer. 

Era 4: What's next?

- Data: We're shifting to Epic!
