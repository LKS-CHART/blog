From identifying fraudulent bank transactions to listing the shows and movies we‚Äôre most likely to enjoy, AI is deeply embedded within our everyday lives. Oftentimes the results or outputs of these decisions are relatively harmless. However, increasingly, machine learning models are trained on complex and sensitive data, and used as part of decision making processes for diagnosing diseases or making hiring decisions. While these models have the ability to transform and improve lives, sometimes the decisions made or informed by AI can have far-reaching consequences.\nAs a part of our team‚Äôs bi-weekly journal clubs, we talked about sources of bias for AI models, the potential consequences and harms they can create, and what we can do as data scientists within the healthcare space.\nBias is everywhere\nBias is a part of human nature, coming from the limited view of the world that any single person or group can achieve. Whether implicitly or explicitly, this bias gets captured within our institutions and by extension - the data that we record. It can be reflected and amplified by artificial intelligence models that are trained using this data. Generally, the bias encoded within AI tools result in the greatest harm toward disadvantaged groups and people, such as racial minorities.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Different types of bias that can exist when training machine learning models source\n\n\n\nThere are a few different ways bias can affect the prediction or decision made by an algorithm (Norori et al. 2021):\nHuman bias: underlying bias within the data caused by societal inequities and biased human decision-making\nData-driven bias: when training data is not representative of the population in which the algorithm will be applied\nAlgorithmic bias: when model development or training methods result in biased outcomes\nBy the same token, harms as a result of biased AI can manifest in different ways:\nHarm of allocation: if people are denied opportunities or resources based on the decision of an AI. An example of this is Amazon‚Äôs resume screening tool that was biased against women because it was trained on data from the past 10 years, which was overwhelmingly male.\nHarm of quality-of-service: when an AI tool does not perform at the same level for one group as it does for another. An example of this may be voice assistants trained on predominantly male voices may have trouble recognizing the voices of women who use it.\nIn this way, AI can be a flawed reflection of our society and its systemic biases, and can become a ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù for jobs, medical treatments, and opportunities.\nHealthcare data, like any data, is flawed\nWithin the context of healthcare services, it is especially important to consider the types of bias within our data, as decisions made with the support of AI have the ability to influence critical decisions such as which patients receive additional care, or what medication dosages are prescribed. As with many other industries, healthcare and medical data can be biased, incorrect, missing, and incomplete.\nEven without the presence of AI tools, healthcare data holds implicit bias. For example, when visiting the emergency department for abdominal pain, men wait an average of 49 minutes before receiving an analgesic, whereas women wait an average of 65 minutes (Chen et al. 2008). The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted many existing racial inequities in healthcare, with the morbidity and mortality rate being higher for Black Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic/Latino patients compared with White Americans (Gawthrop 2022).\nWhen machine learning models are trained using data that already contains historical and societal inequities, these patterns are learned by the model, and the biases can be amplified when making predictions for new patients. Models that are deployed with underlying biases can disadvantage the groups who were under or mis-represented within the training data. For example, algorithms trained to identify disease within chest radiograph images were found to have higher underdiagnosis rates for female patients, patients under 20 years old, Black patients, and Hispanic patients. In other words, the risk of being falsely predicted as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù were higher for these groups of people, meaning their clinical treatment would have been delayed or missed entirely (Seyyed-Kalantari et al. 2021).\nBuilding fairer models\nWe know that our models can contain harmful biases. But what can we do as data scientists in the healthcare space to ensure our models benefit the most people, and don‚Äôt cause harm? This might be a daunting question, one that led to a lot more questions for our team:\nHow can we improve our development and monitoring processes to identify biases before they are deployed?\nShould we have a feedback loop to communicate data discrepancies and inform future data collection?\nHow can we better incorporate the patient experience and expertise?\nCan we incorporate recourse and contestability into our data science pipelines?\nBuilding fairer models is an iterative process, and one that requires more than one solution. Although not all are possible to implement everywhere, especially all at once, below are a few things our team is learning about and working on:\nUnderstanding sources and limitations of data. This involves thinking about where the data coming from and if there‚Äôs potential for any of the variables to be biased. For example, data containing a single variable ‚Äúgender‚Äù with limited responses may actually be a mixture of sex or perceived gender, rather than reflecting a patient‚Äôs true gender identity.\nBuilding models with an interdisciplinary and diverse team. When developing any kind of AI tool for clinical deployment, we heavily collaborate with the clinician teams that are involved. In addition, our project teams consist of people with varied backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and training.\nEvaluating model performance across sub-groups and applying techniques for improving explainability. There are many tools and resources for evaluating model fairness and understanding how a model performs for subgroups. Tools such as InterpretML and modelStudio.\nCreating and following standards for data, processes, models, and reporting. Standardization of these elements of a data science project ensures that there are clear guidelines and expectations, consistency among and across projects, and benchmarks to evaluate quality.\nMonitoring data, model usage, and performance over time. Monitoring how our models are performing after deployment is important to ensure there hasn‚Äôt been any data drift or changes in the environment that may cause poor performance.\nLearning, discussing, and sharing. We believe it‚Äôs important to keep learning, discussing through things like journal clubs, and where possible, sharing our processes, code, research, and learnings.\nAI has countless potential benefits, especially within healthcare - to improve patient care, hospital efficiency, and support decision-making. Working to build fairer models will help improve trust among clinically deployed AI tools, and ensure that all groups of people can benefit from the decisions made and supported by AI.\nTakeaways\nHuman bias, data-driven bias, and algorithmic bias are common ways in which a model might perform poorly for some patient subgroups, causing denial of opportunities or reducing quality of service\nThere is no perfect data, but there are different ways to combat bias and build models that are useful and reduce harms\nSome techniques for building better and fairer models include understanding sources of bias, building models considering multiple perspectives, evaluating them for fairness and explainability, and monitoring after deployment\nAdditional resources\nBelow are the full list of topics and readings that we dove into for our journal club series on bias, fairness, and ethics in healthcare AI.\nTopic\nReading Materials\nIntroduction to Bias, Fairness, and Ethics in AI\nMedicine‚Äôs Machine Learning Problem\nIndigenous Data, Representing Race in AI, and Structural Racism in Healthcare\nStructural racism in precision medicine: leaving no one behind Racial Disparities and Mistrust in End-of-Life Care Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations Racism and Health: Evidence and Needed Research The disturbing return of scientific racism\nMachine Learning Best Practices & Regulations\nFDA In Brief: FDA Collaborates with Health Canada and UK‚Äôs MHRA to Foster Good Machine Learning Practice Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool Suicide hotline shares data with for-profit spinoff, raising ethical questions Their Bionic Eyes are now Obsolete and Unsupported\nFailure modes and Equity Concerns in Medical Imaging Models\nReading Race: AI Recognizes Patient‚Äôs Racial Identity in Medical Images Under-diagnosis bias of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to chest radiographs in under-served patient populations Common pitfalls and recommendations for using machine learning to detect and prognosticate for COVID-19 using chest radiographs and CT scans\nBias and Assessing Model Fairness & Transparency\nMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?

In November 2019 we were ready to move to a silent deployment phase, which means our entire pipeline was running (from data extraction to data processing to model prediction), but no outputs were going to the end-user.\nTypically, the goal of the silent deployment phase is to uncover unexpected behaviors with the data, system, or model. During model development and evaluation, we had only worked with historical extracts of the data. When moving from historical data to live data, there‚Äôs the risk of running into data issues (Cohen et al. 2021).\nThe data can be different due to external factors. For example, all of our models were trained on data prior to COVID-19, but shortly after the beginning of our silent deployment phase, we began to observe cases of COVID-19 in the hospital.\nThe data can be different due to data entry errors. For example, a body temperature could incorrectly be entered as 3700 ¬∞C instead of 37.00 ¬∞C.\nThe data can be different due to selection bias. For example, during training we excluded patients with really short and really long visits, as they were rare. However, we may encounter these kinds of visits in the live data.\nMonitoring labs\nWe had set up a monitoring dashboard to measure model inputs and model outputs. On close inspection, we made a discovery that was unquestionably odd‚Ä¶ no sodium labs had been measured since we had moved to silent testing!\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"attrs\":{\"title\":\"Electrolyte counts\",\"labels\":[\"day\",\"CA\",\"CL\",\"GLPOC\",\"K\",\"NA.\"],\"retainDateWindow\":false,\"axes\":{\"x\":{\"pixelsPerLabel\":60,\"drawAxis\":true},\"y\":{\"drawAxis\":true}},\"stackedGraph\":true,\"fillGraph\":false,\"fillAlpha\":0.15,\"stepPlot\":false,\"drawPoints\":false,\"pointSize\":1,\"drawGapEdgePoints\":false,\"connectSeparatedPoints\":false,\"strokeWidth\":1,\"strokeBorderColor\":\"white\",\"colorValue\":0.5,\"colorSaturation\":1,\"includeZero\":false,\"drawAxesAtZero\":false,\"logscale\":false,\"axisTickSize\":3,\"axisLineColor\":\"black\",\"axisLineWidth\":0.3,\"axisLabelColor\":\"black\",\"axisLabelFontSize\":14,\"axisLabelWidth\":60,\"drawGrid\":true,\"gridLineWidth\":0.3,\"rightGap\":5,\"digitsAfterDecimal\":2,\"labelsKMB\":false,\"labelsKMG2\":false,\"labelsUTC\":false,\"maxNumberWidth\":6,\"animatedZooms\":false,\"mobileDisableYTouch\":true,\"disableZoom\":false,\"legend\":\"auto\",\"labelsDivWidth\":400,\"labelsShowZeroValues\":true,\"labelsSeparateLines\":false,\"hideOverlayOnMouseOut\":true},\"scale\":\"daily\",\"annotations\":[],\"shadings\":[],\"events\":[],\"format\":\"date\",\"data\":[[\"2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-24T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-26T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-27T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-04T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-08T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-09T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-10T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-12T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-13T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-17T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z\"],[18,23,18,19,18,18,20,15,21,11,20,15,15,14,14,9,14,12,7,12,17,13,14,12,21,15,15,24,24,22,13],[51,53,70,64,58,51,62,62,58,57,61,53,60,72,57,62,58,44,38,40,60,48,47,43,65,52,52,56,51,61,66],[56,41,50,56,54,66,51,56,52,60,72,52,79,74,83,91,77,64,60,61,57,68,59,62,55,42,59,65,63,50,70],[51,52,70,63,58,52,62,61,59,57,60,51,60,72,55,62,57,43,37,40,60,47,47,42,64,51,52,54,53,61,65],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],\"fixedtz\":false,\"tzone\":\"UTC\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nFigure 1: Daily counts of lab measurements: this includes counts for calcium (CA), chloride (CL), glucose (GLPOC), potassium (K), and sodium (NA).\n\n\n\nDid this make sense? NA! Sodium is measured in routinely ordered blood tests. It‚Äôll usually get ordered alongside other tests (such as calcium, chloride, glucose, and potassium) as part of a basic metabolic panel. In Figure 1, we look at the daily counts of labs on units in which CHARTwatch was silently deployed. The other labs were regularly measured, but our pipeline had not detected a single sodium lab. There was NA way sodium would be missing!\nThe NA bug\nAfter hours of detective work, we found the issue:\nIn R, the programming language we used to develop CHARTwatch, the symbol NA stands for ‚Äúnot available‚Äù and is used to represent missing data.\nIn chemistry, Na is the symbol used to represent the chemical element of sodium.\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"attrs\":{\"title\":\"Electrolyte counts\",\"labels\":[\"day\",\"CA\",\"CL\",\"GLPOC\",\"K\",\"NA.\"],\"retainDateWindow\":false,\"axes\":{\"x\":{\"pixelsPerLabel\":60,\"drawAxis\":true},\"y\":{\"drawAxis\":true}},\"stackedGraph\":true,\"fillGraph\":false,\"fillAlpha\":0.15,\"stepPlot\":false,\"drawPoints\":false,\"pointSize\":1,\"drawGapEdgePoints\":false,\"connectSeparatedPoints\":false,\"strokeWidth\":1,\"strokeBorderColor\":\"white\",\"colorValue\":0.5,\"colorSaturation\":1,\"includeZero\":false,\"drawAxesAtZero\":false,\"logscale\":false,\"axisTickSize\":3,\"axisLineColor\":\"black\",\"axisLineWidth\":0.3,\"axisLabelColor\":\"black\",\"axisLabelFontSize\":14,\"axisLabelWidth\":60,\"drawGrid\":true,\"gridLineWidth\":0.3,\"rightGap\":5,\"digitsAfterDecimal\":2,\"labelsKMB\":false,\"labelsKMG2\":false,\"labelsUTC\":false,\"maxNumberWidth\":6,\"animatedZooms\":false,\"mobileDisableYTouch\":true,\"disableZoom\":false,\"legend\":\"auto\",\"labelsDivWidth\":400,\"labelsShowZeroValues\":true,\"labelsSeparateLines\":false,\"hideOverlayOnMouseOut\":true},\"scale\":\"daily\",\"annotations\":[],\"shadings\":[],\"events\":[],\"format\":\"date\",\"data\":[[\"2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-24T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-26T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-27T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-04T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-08T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-09T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-10T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-12T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-13T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-17T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-21T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-22T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-24T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-26T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-27T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-28T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-03T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-04T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-08T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-09T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-10T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-12T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-13T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-16T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-17T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-19T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2020-01-20T00:00:00.000Z\"],[18,23,18,19,18,18,20,15,21,11,20,15,15,14,14,9,14,12,7,12,17,13,14,12,21,15,15,24,24,22,13,24,23,17,30,32,25,20,29,16,20,20,16,18,23,21,23,26,21,16,17,14,15,14,16,16,21,22,19,24,25,23,33],[51,53,70,64,58,51,62,62,58,57,61,53,60,72,57,62,58,44,38,40,60,48,47,43,65,52,52,56,51,61,66,72,66,62,87,77,60,81,79,70,67,61,53,53,82,76,74,85,76,91,85,75,74,73,63,72,65,80,65,68,62,54,74],[56,41,50,56,54,66,51,56,52,60,72,52,79,74,83,91,77,64,60,61,57,68,59,62,55,42,59,65,63,50,70,68,69,82,90,82,80,84,70,87,98,67,62,64,113,100,87,105,75,91,109,120,109,92,82,91,65,79,69,58,48,58,62],[51,52,70,63,58,52,62,61,59,57,60,51,60,72,55,62,57,43,37,40,60,47,47,42,64,51,52,54,53,61,65,72,66,62,86,77,60,81,79,70,66,61,53,53,79,75,74,86,76,90,84,75,74,72,63,72,64,80,66,67,62,55,73],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,68,66,62,87,77,60,81,79,70,67,61,53,53,82,76,75,85,77,91,84,75,74,73,63,72,65,80,65,68,62,54,73]],\"fixedtz\":false,\"tzone\":\"UTC\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nFigure 2: Daily counts of lab measurements after fixing the NA bug\n\n\n\nDepending on the context, the symbol meant something different! Our data extraction pipeline was interpreting the chemical element Na as ‚Äúnot available!‚Äù\nThe fix was quite straightforward. We updated the parameters of one of our function calls to specify that \"\" (empty string) should be used to represent ‚Äúnot available,‚Äù instead of \"NA\". From the documentation of the RODBC package:\n\nna.strings: character string(s) to be mapped to NA when reading character data, default ‚ÄúNA‚Äù\n\nAfter deploying this fix, sodium counts were back to normal (as seen in Figure 2).\nWhile the fix was a simple one-line change, the problem we uncovered lead to plenty of follow-up questions!\nWere there other cases where the same symbol meant two different things based on the context?\nWhat does our electronic health record use to represent a missing value? Do they go with a number that‚Äôs biologically impossible? (e.g., a body temperature of -1000) Do they use a specific symbol/term? (e.g., ‚Äúnot measured,‚Äù ‚Äúmissing‚Äù)\nHow are these decisions made?\nRecently, there‚Äôs been a push for improvement in data quality standards, such as ‚ÄúDatasheets for Datasets‚Äù (Gebru et al. 2021) and the explosion of features stores, model stores, and evaluation stores1.\nTakeaways\nNA (sodium) ‚â† NA (not available)\nSilent deployment is important.\nThorough metadata and data quality standards are important to mitigating these kinds of issues.\n\n\n\nCohen, Joseph Paul, Tianshi Cao, Joseph D.
