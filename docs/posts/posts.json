A recording of the talk is available here and a PDF of the accompanying slides can be found here.\n\nA success story\nHere at DSAA, we developed CHARTwatch, an early warning system for detecting patient deterioration. The system runs every hour:\nFirst, CHARTwatch ingests laboratory values, vital measurements, and demographics.\nThen, CHARTwatch classifies each visit into the following group: High risk vs Medium risk vs Low risk.\nThe risk group predictions are then delivered through different methods:\nEmails\nUpdates to a front-end tool\nAlerts sent to phones\n\nFinally, on August 2020, CHARTwatch went live and we were able to deploy to the General Internal Medicine (GIM) ward!! Developing and deploying CHARTwatch was a difficult feat and wouldn’t have been possible without the help of a few friends…\nTools for development\nDatabase connections\nThere are various data systems in the hospital, all with their own quirks and intricacies. In order to make it easier for the Advanced Analytics team to work with the different hospital databases, we developed chartdb, an internal R package.\nThe connection functions follow the same pattern, making it easier for data scientists and data analysts to work with databases.\n\n\ncon_a <- chartdb::connect_databaseA(username = ..., password = ...)\ncon_b <- chartdb::connect_databaseB(username = ..., password = ...)\ncon_edw <- chartdb::connect_edw(username = ..., password = ...)\ncon_soarian <- chartdb::connect_soarian(username = ..., password = ...)\ncon_mak <- chartdb::connect_mak(username = ..., password = ...)\ncon_syngo <- chartdb::connect_syngo(username = ..., password = ...)\n\n\n\nA reproducible environment\n\nA one-sentence horror story: “It works on my machine.”\n\n\nTo improve reproducibility, we use renv, an R package for R dependency management.\nWhen setting up your renv environment, the renv.lock will keep track of the different packages (and their versions!!). If a new person needs to work on the project, they can use the renv.lock file to download the same packages and the same package versions! Woohoo!\nPackage-based development\nWhy write a package?\nPlenty! Of! Reasons!\nIn particular, writing a package makes it easy to share code and knowledge with others.\nAnd, writing a package greatly reduces the amount of times you’re copy-pasting code. Really, it’s a win-win-win situation!\nEnvironment! Environment! Environments\nWe typically work with 3 different environment.\nThe development environment is the one on your local computer or your development server.\nThe staging environment is as close to the “real” deployment environment as possible.\nThe production environment is where things actually get deployed. Speaking of production environments, now’s a great time to talk about the tools we need for deployment. Before doing that though, time for…\nAn interlude\nA multi-sentence horror story:\n\nIn earlier attempts to deploy CHARTwatch, we were using multiple CRON jobs… that called different bash scripts… which then called different Python/R/Java scripts. Oh, and we had no separate environments. Or rather, we only had one environment, where test environment = staging environment = production environment\n\n\nTools for deployment\nInterlude over! Let’s looks the tools we need for deployment.\nAuthentication\n\nWe rely on Posit Connect for this. Posit Connect works with the hospital Active Directory, which enables administrators to manage permissions and access. What does this mean?\nDevelopers don’t need to keep track of an extra server username and password.\nEnd-users can log in with their hospital credentials!\nScheduling\nPosit Connect also gives us the ability to schedule scripts through their admin interface.\nDowntime\nKnowing when things don’t work is crucial for deployment.\nWe use jarvis, our own internally-developed R package, to email and Slack notifications alerting us of issues.\nEach project will also have downtime protocol which defines the steps that various team members must take when something isn’t working.\nFor example, when a CHARTwatch downtime affects end-users, an email alert is sent to the entire hospital. Not all projects will require something like this, but since CHARTwatch is embedded in clinical care, many need to be aware of the downtime.\n\nA secure way to download internally-developed packages\nWe need to limit who can access the hospital network. Posit Package Manager is a repository package management that lets us download packages while being disconnected from the Internet.\nAn implementation plan\nDeploying an early warning system in the hospital involves working with many different groups. All worked together to develop the implementation plan. Some takeaways from the implementation plan:\nConsider existing resources! There’s no point in re-implementing a workflow that already exists.\nFor example, notifications were designed so that they fit within existing processes. Emails to charge nurses were sent at times that made the most sense based on their shifts.\n\nHave a silent deployment period! This is useful for identifying unexpected bugs.\nOne bug we found in silent deployment was caused by a particular NAsty lab…\n\nFind out more\nThis is a very very very very brief overview of CHARTwatch and how we develop and deploy models in the hospital. Check out the reading list below for more details.\nTo learn more about CHARTwatch’s model development and validation, see: “Preparing a Clinical Support Model for Silent Mode in General Internal Medicine” by Nestor et al. (2020).\nTo learn more about the process changes that were required for CHARTwatch’s implementation, see: “Implementing Machine Learning in Medicine” by Verma et al. (2021)\nTo read all about the technical infrastructure that lead to CHARTwatch’s deployment, see: “From Compute to Care: Lessons Learned from Deploying an Early Warning System into Clinical Practice” by Pou-Prom et al. (2022)\nTo find out all about the data that is used to train CHARTwatch, see: “GIM, a dataset for predicting patient deterioration in the General Internal Medicine ward (version 1.0.0)” by Kuzulugil et al. (2022)\nThis white paper by Signal1: “The Burden of Clinical Deterioration and How One Hospital is Tackling it with Machine Learning”\n\n\n\n",

For those who are unfamiliar, Spotify Wrapped is a yearly marketing campaign by Spotify, where they compile streaming data and create a personalized graphic for each user. 1\nIn the spirit of data, end-of-year reflections, and colorful infographics, we thought it would be fun to create our very own DSAA wrapped!\nEnjoy some stats!!\n\n\n\nProjects\n2022 was a busy year with lots of projects!!\nTotal # of projects deployed: 9\nMost viewed project: Ops Centre\nThe Ops Centre project provides a clear picture of patient flow within the hospital. It consists of multiple data tiles that reflect real-time data in the areas of occupancy, upcoming discharges, planned admissions, bed cleaning, portering, and other elements essential to providing a full-picture of patient flow.\n\nProject with the most team members whose names start with M: Hemodialysis\nThe Hemodialysis project is a weekly digest tool for clinicians at the St. Michael’s Hospital hemodialysis clinics. The tool provides patients’ risks of a unplanned hospital visits.\n\nProduct families\n2022 was the year of product families.2\n\nWhoa, wait. What exactly is a product family?\nProduct at DSAA is a platform, application, system, or report that is created to meet patient, clinician, or hospital operational needs.\nProduct family (roughly comparable to a product line) is a group of related products that are developed and maintained by a single cross-functional team at DSAA.\nWe adopted this custom framework in order to allow staff to work effectively within persistent teams and to leverage resources across products the best we can. The products under each product family are related by common product value and/or shared domain expertise requirement.\nSome product family stats!\nNumber of product families: 6\nProduct family with the most projects: The Patient Flow product family 3\nThe Patient Flow product family aims to make the patients journey though the hospital as safe and comfortable as possible without compromising care. The Ops Centre is an example of a project that is part of this family.\n\nDSAA and improvement\n2022 was a year where we focused on improving existing operations.\n# of sprint improvement weeks: 3\nThe sprint improvement week is a full week dedicated to DSAA process improvement work in the areas of data infrastructure, source system optimization, DevOps, data governance, databases, analytics and project management processes, and more! The DSAA team works together to clear a backlog of tasks, and then we share our accomplishments through demos at the end of the week.\nSome notable achievements from past sprint improvement weeks are: our very own DSAA handbook, maintenance and update of internally-developed packages, and experimenting with containers!\n\n# of blog posts: 5\n2022 is when we re-launched this blog!\n\n# of journal club sessions lead by the Advanced Analytics team: at least 16\nWe covered the following topics: AI ethics, equity, & inclusion, anomaly detection4, survival analysis, Canadian healthcare.\n\n# of “sheets” created: 35\nTemplates! Templates! Templates! We worked on templates for: Datasheet, Factsheet, and Models card sheet.\n\n# of Advanced Analytics mini-demos: 8\nMini-demos are lead by a different Advanced Analytics team member and include (you guessed it) a mini-demo!! Usually, one of the team members will try out a cool new package or talk about a fun/interesting/challenging problem they ran into. For example, we had a mini-demo on the funneljoin package.\n\nDSAA’s social committee\nOur team’s social committee (a.k.a. the Party Planning Committee) (a.k.a. the Party Planning Pandas) have organized some GREAT events this year.\n# of steps completed during the Step Challenge: 1,983,000\nThe Step Challenge was 1-week challenge in May where team members were encouraged to get as many steps in as possible! The max # of daily steps was 32,998 and the min # of daily steps was 246.\n\n# of “wizard” classes: 3\nWizard classes are DSAA-lead classes to learn something fun. This year we learned how to bake puff pastries, how to play euchre and how to make pizza.\nSpeaking of pizza….\n\n# of pizzas made by DSAA team members: \\(\\infty\\)\nPizza lesson night was very popular!!! Check out some of delicious pizzas that team members made:\n\n\n\nMost requested album: The Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack\nDuring the year, many of our team members would hop on a Zoom call, play some music, and work together. The most played album was the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack, very closely followed by lo-fi chill hip hop.\n\n… and that’s a wrap!\n2022 was a great year and we’re looking forward to 2023.\nSome things you can expect in the new year:\nMore blog posts!!!!!!!!6\nMore pizza!\nMore journal club sessions. We’re looking forward to reading up on NLP and timeseries!\nMore steps!\n\nWe surveyed the members on DSAA and found that the most listened music genre is Pop, followed by various interesting variations of Indie (indie pop, indie soul, indie Québécois).↩︎\nBlog post coming soon!! 🤞↩︎\nFun fact: The Patient Flow product family is also the product family with the most Fast & Furious memes.↩︎\nblog post coming soon! :-)↩︎\nBlog post coming soon!!! 🙏↩︎\nWe promised a few in this blog post, so now we’re on the hook!↩︎\n",

To learn a bit more about CHARTWatch you should read (Verma et al. 2021) that explains how to get models in the clinical environment and (Pou-Prom et al., n.d.) on all the technical parts required.\nWe were doing some data exploration for the project and we had a fairly straight forward question to answer: What is the first event after a procedure for a patient?\nWith that question, I dove into the data files we had started to get a feel for what to do2. I had a few files to work with, lots of timestamps all over the place, and knew I had some sort of join type problem. I tried—and failed with—many variations of joins (e.g., fuzzyjoin) and even trying to get what was needed in more manual3 ways. One thought kept ringing in my head: “someone must have solved this problem.” So at that point I spent a few half days4 searching. Many fruitless paths later and on the verge of the more manual5 approaches I finally found what I was looking for: funneljoin.\nThough funneljoin was what I was looking for, my use of it was also a journey through multiple mistakes and misunderstandings all of which are my own6. But I eventually got exactly what I wanted: a straightforward way to join some data and find very specific events that occur after other events.\nA quick view of the data\nLet’s start out by taking a look at the data. That’ll give us a better sense of the problem and the behavior we’re expecting. We’re going to be working with a tiny example of what the real data could look like. These fake data have been created from real data and then we used uuid, dplyr::group_by, lubridate and some good old fashioned randomization to make it fake.\nWe have two data files which look a lot like our real data:\nALL_ADT_EVENTS.csv: A file that contains all the Admit-Discharge-Transfer (ADT) events for patients while they are in the hospital, and\nSPECIFIC_PROCEDURES.csv: which contains a very specific set of procedures while in the hospital.\nIt’s very worth noting that all the events in SPECIFIC_PROCEDURES are in ALL_ADT_EVENTS. These are separate for a few reasons including (but certainly not limited to): it’s easier to work with when we want to know only about the procedures, and things like procedures can (and are) pulled from separate pipelines more specific than ADT pipelines.\nA look at the data\nLet’s start out by taking a look at some of the ADT file and a few (preselected) rows to highlight these data. And while we’re at it, we’ll see the code, too!\n\n\nlibrary(here)       ## for here::here() and referencing files from this .RProj\nlibrary(dplyr)      ## for some processing and those fancy pipes\nlibrary(kableExtra) ## for some extra fancy looking tables\nlibrary(rmarkdown)  ## for some even more extra fancy tables\n\nADT_FILE_PATH <- here::here(\"_posts\",\"2022-08-12-putting-the-fun-in-funneljoin\", \"ALL_ADT_EVENTS.csv\")\nADT_EVENTS <- read.csv(ADT_FILE_PATH, \n                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\nADT_EVENTS %>%\n  slice( c(1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21) ) %>%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %>%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling() \n\n\n\nENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\n\n\nEVENT_TS_FUZZED\n\n\nFROM_SERVICE\n\n\nTO_SERVICE\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-05-10 06:08:10\n\n\nNA\n\n\nED TRIAGE\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-05-10 06:13:24\n\n\nED TRIAGE\n\n\nED TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-05-10 06:54:10\n\n\nED TRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-13 11:32:48\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-18 19:53:13\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 10:27:06\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-28 02:14:32\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-29 22:09:10\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nIn our table we see some (preselected) rows and all of our columns. We’re looking at just 1 patient (ENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED) with a snapshot of some of their events (EVENT_TS_FUZZED), which service they were coming from (FROM_SERVICE) and which service they were going to (TO_SERVICE).\nLet’s now take a look at the SPECIFIC_PROCEDURES data\n\n\nPROCEDURE_FILE_PATH <- here::here(\"_posts\",\"2022-08-12-putting-the-fun-in-funneljoin\", \"SPECIFIC_PROCEDURES.csv\")\nSPECIFIC_PROCEDURES <- read.csv(PROCEDURE_FILE_PATH,\n                                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\nSPECIFIC_PROCEDURES %>%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %>%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling() \n\n\n\nENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\n\n\nEVENT_TS_FUZZED\n\n\nFROM_SERVICE\n\n\nTO_SERVICE\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 10:27:06\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 21:34:13\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\n7cc7972a-58a1-4c78-a0dc-83021c6dc0c6\n\n\n2083-06-02 10:46:45\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\n7cc7972a-58a1-4c78-a0dc-83021c6dc0c6\n\n\n2083-06-22 02:59:57\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\n87d439b0-4f26-4b73-8df3-bf5dbbf34ca7\n\n\n2090-09-05 15:01:52\n\n\nNEUROSURGERY\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE NEURO SURGERY\n\n\nWe’re showing all of SPECIFIC_PROCEDURES because it’s much smaller. It has the same structure as the ADT file (and that’s because the procedures are a subset of all the ADT events). Now that we see the procedures we can also see that it’s an event in ADT_EVENTS. The first SPECIFIC_PROCEDURE:\n\n\nSPECIFIC_PROCEDURES %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %>%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling() \n\n\n\nENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\n\n\nEVENT_TS_FUZZED\n\n\nFROM_SERVICE\n\n\nTO_SERVICE\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 10:27:06\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\nand now the ADT events with the event before, the procedure event, and the event after (which is what we want to specifically identify; eventually that is).\n\n\nADT_EVENTS %>%\n  slice( c(15, 16, 17) ) %>%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %>%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling() \n\n\n\nENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\n\n\nEVENT_TS_FUZZED\n\n\nFROM_SERVICE\n\n\nTO_SERVICE\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-18 20:02:58\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 10:27:06\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 19:54:10\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nA fun note before we move on: When you look at these data you’ll see some NA in there. Those NA are Rs NA which is effectively missing data. In this case NA is absolutely not NA which is sodium (sodium is not a service). You should really take a look at some of the “fun” with NA we’ve had.\nWhat we want and the behavior we’d expect\nOur task was to identify the event that happens after specific procedures. From the above, we can see an example of that:\n\n\nADT_EVENTS %>%\n  slice( c(16, 17) ) %>%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %>%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling() \n\n\n\nENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\n\n\nEVENT_TS_FUZZED\n\n\nFROM_SERVICE\n\n\nTO_SERVICE\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 10:27:06\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 19:54:10\n\n\nINTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\n\n\nTRAUMA\n\n\nThe first row is the procedure and the second row is the event that happens after a specific procedure. At the end of what we do, we want all of those events after procedures because we needed to understand more about patient movements after procedures for some of our modelling.\nA journey to find and a journey through funneljoin\nGiven that we have two data sets and we know that we want to match on certain things (ENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED) but conditional on subsequent time stamps (EVENT_TS_FUZZED), we probably have some sort of join problem.\nI spent a lot of time trying out a lot of the standard join and merge options we find in R: dplyr, base::merge, and even ventured off into the land of fuzzyjoin. I tried a lot of things and all of those things were wrong or overly complicated.\nSo instead of just writing some code to find the next line in the ADT events data after a matching line in the procedures data, I spent a few7 half days8 searching for a package that probably does the thing I’m looking for. It took me quite a while and a variety of search terms (e.g., “time series join,” “join events after,” “fuzzyjoin for time,” “why doesn’t this specific thing I want exist and why am I so bad at this?”) until I eventually found funneljoin9.\nThe funneljoin package includes a lot of join options for time series data. In particular after_join is when we’re looking for events in one data set that occur after events in another data set. That was exactly what I was looking for. Though after_join was the key to solving my problems, I still had a few more problems10 but did eventually figure it all out and it was magical. Let’s walk through three examples with these data and after_join to show where I failed and where I eventually succeeded.\nMy first failure\nI dove into after_join with, basically, the default parameters. So let’s break this down:\nx is our procedures data because that’s our reference point: we want ADT events after procedures\ny is our ADT data to get those events after procedures\nby_user is the column we use for identifiers (ENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED); this is a very typical parameter to expect in join and merge, as we usually want to join data sets based on some identifier\nby_time is the column we use to find the events (EVENT_TS_FUZZED); this is how funneljoin makes use of time series data\nsuffix appends labels to the newly created columns after the join, respectively for x then y\nSeems straight forward enough! Let’s see what happens:\n\n\nlibrary(funneljoin)\n\njoin_attempt_one <- after_join(\n  x = SPECIFIC_PROCEDURES,\n  y = ADT_EVENTS,\n  by_user = \"ENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\",\n  by_time = \"EVENT_TS_FUZZED\",\n  suffix = c(\"_PROCEDURES\",\"_ADT\")\n)\n\nrmarkdown::paged_table(join_attempt_one)\n\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"ENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"EVENT_TS_FUZZED_PROCEDURES\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"FROM_SERVICE_PROCEDURES\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"TO_SERVICE_PROCEDURES\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"EVENT_TS_FUZZED_ADT\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"FROM_SERVICE_ADT\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"TO_SERVICE_ADT\"],\"name\":[7],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  \n\nErr… it sort of looks like nothing happens. Why is that? Well it’s because our resulting join is empty11\nMy second failure\nI clearly missed something12. On a closer look at the parameters, it seemed like I needed a couple of more to make things work. So I brought them in and tried:\nmode is inner which is a specific type of join which is basically the intersection\ntype here is one of many options on how to think about the join and we set it to first-firstafter\nBefore we dive into the updated code let’s pause for what type is and what first-firstafter means. Heavily borrowing from the funneljoin site:\nfirst-firstafter: Take the first x, then the first y after that. For example, we have the first procedure for the first patient in the procedures (x) data, and we want the first event from the ADT (y) data that occurs afterwards. We don’t want all afterward, we don’t want any before. Just the one! So let’s try it:\n\n\njoin_attempt_two <- after_join(\n  x = SPECIFIC_PROCEDURES,\n  y = ADT_EVENTS,\n  by_user = \"ENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\",\n  by_time = \"EVENT_TS_FUZZED\",\n  suffix = c(\"_PROCEDURES\",\"_ADT\"),\n  mode = \"inner\",\n  type = \"first-firstafter\"\n)\n\nrmarkdown::paged_table(join_attempt_two)\n\n\n\n\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"ENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"EVENT_TS_FUZZED_PROCEDURES\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"FROM_SERVICE_PROCEDURES\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"TO_SERVICE_PROCEDURES\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"EVENT_TS_FUZZED_ADT\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"FROM_SERVICE_ADT\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"TO_SERVICE_ADT\"],\"name\":[7],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"a4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\",\"2\":\"2082-06-22 10:27:06\",\"3\":\"TRAUMA\",\"4\":\"INTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\",\"5\":\"2082-06-22 10:27:06\",\"6\":\"TRAUMA\",\"7\":\"INTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\"},{\"1\":\"7cc7972a-58a1-4c78-a0dc-83021c6dc0c6\",\"2\":\"2083-06-02 10:46:45\",\"3\":\"TRAUMA\",\"4\":\"INTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\",\"5\":\"2083-06-02 10:46:45\",\"6\":\"TRAUMA\",\"7\":\"INTENSIVE CARE TRAUMA\"},{\"1\":\"87d439b0-4f26-4b73-8df3-bf5dbbf34ca7\",\"2\":\"2090-09-05 15:01:52\",\"3\":\"NEUROSURGERY\",\"4\":\"INTENSIVE CARE NEURO SURGERY\",\"5\":\"2090-09-05 15:01:52\",\"6\":\"NEUROSURGERY\",\"7\":\"INTENSIVE CARE NEURO SURGERY\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  \n\nThe above shows the whole table but let’s take a closer look at something…\n\n\nENCOUNTER_NUM_ANONYMIZED\n\n\nEVENT_TS_FUZZED_PROCEDURES\n\n\nEVENT_TS_FUZZED_ADT\n\n\na4461971-22e1-46e1-8454-aa7fbce54205\n\n\n2082-06-22 10:27:06\n\n\n2082-06-22 10:27:06\n\n\n7cc7972a-58a1-4c78-a0dc-83021c6dc0c6\n\n\n2083-06-02 10:46:45\n\n\n2083-06-02 10:46:45\n\n\n87d439b0-4f26-4b73-8df3-bf5dbbf34ca7\n\n\n2090-09-05 15:01:52\n\n\n2090-09-05 15:01:52\n\n\nWell that didn’t quite work because it’s actually finding the same time stamped events.

Right now, we’re getting back the same event. Fortunately there’s a parameter for that:\nmin_gap allows us to specify how much time there must be in between the first-firstafter events. There are also two companion parameters to this: max_gap and gap_col which tell us, respectively, the maximum time between events and a column to include the gap in time itself.

It is also a safe assumption to conclude that I’ve used an excessive amount of unnecessary footnotes14.\nWhen we look back at these data and the problem, we probably could have solved this with some dplyr::group_by at the encounter (ID) level, do some checks on the timestamps, and some stuff like that. But we had these two data sets—each used separately for different reasons in the same project—so why not make this easy and intuitive? That’s the major advantage of funneljoin here.\nMaybe the way I solved this problem with funneljoin could have been better15, but this was really useful for me. It was also a super useful exercise for us to find this package and start to understand it because we deal with a lot of time stamps. We often have frequent questions about order of events, or we have to pull multiple pieces of data together from a variety of source systems and ensure it’s all in the right order.\nAnd learning funneljoin was fun and you can tell because it’s literally in the name.\n\n\n\nPou-Prom, Chloé, Joshua Murray, Sebnem Kuzulugil, Muhammad Mamdani, and Amol Verma. n.d. “From Compute to Care: Lessons Learned from Deploying an Early Warning System into Clinical Practice.” Frontiers in Digital Health, 174. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.932123/abstract.\n\n\nVerma, Amol A., Joshua Murray, Russell Greiner, Joseph Paul Cohen, Kaveh G.

From identifying fraudulent bank transactions to listing the shows and movies we’re most likely to enjoy, AI is deeply embedded within our everyday lives. Oftentimes the results or outputs of these decisions are relatively harmless. However, increasingly, machine learning models are trained on complex and sensitive data, and used as part of decision making processes for diagnosing diseases or making hiring decisions. While these models have the ability to transform and improve lives, sometimes the decisions made or informed by AI can have far-reaching consequences.\nAs a part of our team’s bi-weekly journal clubs, we talked about sources of bias for AI models, the potential consequences and harms they can create, and what we can do as data scientists within the healthcare space.\nBias is everywhere\nBias is a part of human nature, coming from the limited view of the world that any single person or group can achieve. Whether implicitly or explicitly, this bias gets captured within our institutions and by extension - the data that we record. It can be reflected and amplified by artificial intelligence models that are trained using this data. Generally, the bias encoded within AI tools result in the greatest harm toward disadvantaged groups and people, such as racial minorities.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Different types of bias that can exist when training machine learning models source\n\n\n\nThere are a few different ways bias can affect the prediction or decision made by an algorithm (Norori et al. 2021):\nHuman bias: underlying bias within the data caused by societal inequities and biased human decision-making\nData-driven bias: when training data is not representative of the population in which the algorithm will be applied\nAlgorithmic bias: when model development or training methods result in biased outcomes\nBy the same token, harms as a result of biased AI can manifest in different ways:\nHarm of allocation: if people are denied opportunities or resources based on the decision of an AI. An example of this is Amazon’s resume screening tool that was biased against women because it was trained on data from the past 10 years, which was overwhelmingly male.\nHarm of quality-of-service: when an AI tool does not perform at the same level for one group as it does for another. An example of this may be voice assistants trained on predominantly male voices may have trouble recognizing the voices of women who use it.\nIn this way, AI can be a flawed reflection of our society and its systemic biases, and can become a “gatekeeper” for jobs, medical treatments, and opportunities.\nHealthcare data, like any data, is flawed\nWithin the context of healthcare services, it is especially important to consider the types of bias within our data, as decisions made with the support of AI have the ability to influence critical decisions such as which patients receive additional care, or what medication dosages are prescribed. As with many other industries, healthcare and medical data can be biased, incorrect, missing, and incomplete.\nEven without the presence of AI tools, healthcare data holds implicit bias. For example, when visiting the emergency department for abdominal pain, men wait an average of 49 minutes before receiving an analgesic, whereas women wait an average of 65 minutes (Chen et al. 2008). The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted many existing racial inequities in healthcare, with the morbidity and mortality rate being higher for Black Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic/Latino patients compared with White Americans (Gawthrop 2022).\nWhen machine learning models are trained using data that already contains historical and societal inequities, these patterns are learned by the model, and the biases can be amplified when making predictions for new patients. Models that are deployed with underlying biases can disadvantage the groups who were under or mis-represented within the training data. For example, algorithms trained to identify disease within chest radiograph images were found to have higher underdiagnosis rates for female patients, patients under 20 years old, Black patients, and Hispanic patients. In other words, the risk of being falsely predicted as “healthy” were higher for these groups of people, meaning their clinical treatment would have been delayed or missed entirely (Seyyed-Kalantari et al. 2021).\nBuilding fairer models\nWe know that our models can contain harmful biases. But what can we do as data scientists in the healthcare space to ensure our models benefit the most people, and don’t cause harm? This might be a daunting question, one that led to a lot more questions for our team:\nHow can we improve our development and monitoring processes to identify biases before they are deployed?\nShould we have a feedback loop to communicate data discrepancies and inform future data collection?\nHow can we better incorporate the patient experience and expertise?\nCan we incorporate recourse and contestability into our data science pipelines?\nBuilding fairer models is an iterative process, and one that requires more than one solution. Although not all are possible to implement everywhere, especially all at once, below are a few things our team is learning about and working on:\nUnderstanding sources and limitations of data. This involves thinking about where the data coming from and if there’s potential for any of the variables to be biased. For example, data containing a single variable “gender” with limited responses may actually be a mixture of sex or perceived gender, rather than reflecting a patient’s true gender identity.\nBuilding models with an interdisciplinary and diverse team. When developing any kind of AI tool for clinical deployment, we heavily collaborate with the clinician teams that are involved. In addition, our project teams consist of people with varied backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and training.\nEvaluating model performance across sub-groups and applying techniques for improving explainability. There are many tools and resources for evaluating model fairness and understanding how a model performs for subgroups. Tools such as InterpretML and modelStudio.\nCreating and following standards for data, processes, models, and reporting. Standardization of these elements of a data science project ensures that there are clear guidelines and expectations, consistency among and across projects, and benchmarks to evaluate quality.\nMonitoring data, model usage, and performance over time. Monitoring how our models are performing after deployment is important to ensure there hasn’t been any data drift or changes in the environment that may cause poor performance.\nLearning, discussing, and sharing. We believe it’s important to keep learning, discussing through things like journal clubs, and where possible, sharing our processes, code, research, and learnings.\nAI has countless potential benefits, especially within healthcare - to improve patient care, hospital efficiency, and support decision-making. Working to build fairer models will help improve trust among clinically deployed AI tools, and ensure that all groups of people can benefit from the decisions made and supported by AI.\nTakeaways\nHuman bias, data-driven bias, and algorithmic bias are common ways in which a model might perform poorly for some patient subgroups, causing denial of opportunities or reducing quality of service\nThere is no perfect data, but there are different ways to combat bias and build models that are useful and reduce harms\nSome techniques for building better and fairer models include understanding sources of bias, building models considering multiple perspectives, evaluating them for fairness and explainability, and monitoring after deployment\nAdditional resources\nBelow are the full list of topics and readings that we dove into for our journal club series on bias, fairness, and ethics in healthcare AI.\nTopic\nReading Materials\nIntroduction to Bias, Fairness, and Ethics in AI\nMedicine’s Machine Learning Problem\nIndigenous Data, Representing Race in AI, and Structural Racism in Healthcare\nStructural racism in precision medicine: leaving no one behind Racial Disparities and Mistrust in End-of-Life Care Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations Racism and Health: Evidence and Needed Research The disturbing return of scientific racism\nMachine Learning Best Practices & Regulations\nFDA In Brief: FDA Collaborates with Health Canada and UK’s MHRA to Foster Good Machine Learning Practice Algorithmic Impact Assessment tool Suicide hotline shares data with for-profit spinoff, raising ethical questions Their Bionic Eyes are now Obsolete and Unsupported\nFailure modes and Equity Concerns in Medical Imaging Models\nReading Race: AI Recognizes Patient’s Racial Identity in Medical Images Under-diagnosis bias of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to chest radiographs in under-served patient populations Common pitfalls and recommendations for using machine learning to detect and prognosticate for COVID-19 using chest radiographs and CT scans\nBias and Assessing Model Fairness & Transparency\nMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?

In November 2019 we were ready to move to a silent deployment phase, which means our entire pipeline was running (from data extraction to data processing to model prediction), but no outputs were going to the end-user.\nTypically, the goal of the silent deployment phase is to uncover unexpected behaviors with the data, system, or model. During model development and evaluation, we had only worked with historical extracts of the data. When moving from historical data to live data, there’s the risk of running into data issues (Cohen et al. 2021).\nThe data can be different due to external factors. For example, all of our models were trained on data prior to COVID-19, but shortly after the beginning of our silent deployment phase, we began to observe cases of COVID-19 in the hospital.\nThe data can be different due to data entry errors. For example, a body temperature could incorrectly be entered as 3700 °C instead of 37.00 °C.\nThe data can be different due to selection bias. For example, during training we excluded patients with really short and really long visits, as they were rare. However, we may encounter these kinds of visits in the live data.\nMonitoring labs\nWe had set up a monitoring dashboard to measure model inputs and model outputs. On close inspection, we made a discovery that was unquestionably odd… no sodium labs had been measured since we had moved to silent testing!\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"attrs\":{\"title\":\"Electrolyte counts\",\"labels\":[\"day\",\"CA\",\"CL\",\"GLPOC\",\"K\",\"NA.\"],\"retainDateWindow\":false,\"axes\":{\"x\":{\"pixelsPerLabel\":60,\"drawAxis\":true},\"y\":{\"drawAxis\":true}},\"stackedGraph\":true,\"fillGraph\":false,\"fillAlpha\":0.15,\"stepPlot\":false,\"drawPoints\":false,\"pointSize\":1,\"drawGapEdgePoints\":false,\"connectSeparatedPoints\":false,\"strokeWidth\":1,\"strokeBorderColor\":\"white\",\"colorValue\":0.5,\"colorSaturation\":1,\"includeZero\":false,\"drawAxesAtZero\":false,\"logscale\":false,\"axisTickSize\":3,\"axisLineColor\":\"black\",\"axisLineWidth\":0.3,\"axisLabelColor\":\"black\",\"axisLabelFontSize\":14,\"axisLabelWidth\":60,\"drawGrid\":true,\"gridLineWidth\":0.3,\"rightGap\":5,\"digitsAfterDecimal\":2,\"labelsKMB\":false,\"labelsKMG2\":false,\"labelsUTC\":false,\"maxNumberWidth\":6,\"animatedZooms\":false,\"mobileDisableYTouch\":true,\"disableZoom\":false,\"legend\":\"auto\",\"labelsDivWidth\":400,\"labelsShowZeroValues\":true,\"labelsSeparateLines\":false,\"hideOverlayOnMouseOut\":true},\"scale\":\"daily\",\"annotations\":[],\"shadings\":[],\"events\":[],\"format\":\"date\",\"data\":[[\"2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-24T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-26T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-27T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-04T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-08T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-09T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-10T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-12T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-13T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-17T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z\"],[18,23,18,19,18,18,20,15,21,11,20,15,15,14,14,9,14,12,7,12,17,13,14,12,21,15,15,24,24,22,13],[51,53,70,64,58,51,62,62,58,57,61,53,60,72,57,62,58,44,38,40,60,48,47,43,65,52,52,56,51,61,66],[56,41,50,56,54,66,51,56,52,60,72,52,79,74,83,91,77,64,60,61,57,68,59,62,55,42,59,65,63,50,70],[51,52,70,63,58,52,62,61,59,57,60,51,60,72,55,62,57,43,37,40,60,47,47,42,64,51,52,54,53,61,65],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],\"fixedtz\":false,\"tzone\":\"UTC\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nFigure 1: Daily counts of lab measurements: this includes counts for calcium (CA), chloride (CL), glucose (GLPOC), potassium (K), and sodium (NA).\n\n\n\nDid this make sense? NA! Sodium is measured in routinely ordered blood tests. It’ll usually get ordered alongside other tests (such as calcium, chloride, glucose, and potassium) as part of a basic metabolic panel. In Figure 1, we look at the daily counts of labs on units in which CHARTwatch was silently deployed. The other labs were regularly measured, but our pipeline had not detected a single sodium lab.

Our data extraction pipeline was interpreting the chemical element Na as “not available!”\nThe fix was quite straightforward. We updated the parameters of one of our function calls to specify that \"\" (empty string) should be used to represent “not available,” instead of \"NA\". From the documentation of the RODBC package:\n\nna.strings: character string(s) to be mapped to NA when reading character data, default “NA”\n\nAfter deploying this fix, sodium counts were back to normal (as seen in Figure 2).\nWhile the fix was a simple one-line change, the problem we uncovered lead to plenty of follow-up questions!\nWere there other cases where the same symbol meant two different things based on the context?\nWhat does our electronic health record use to represent a missing value? Do they go with a number that’s biologically impossible? (e.g., a body temperature of -1000) Do they use a specific symbol/term? (e.g., “not measured,” “missing”)\nHow are these decisions made?\nRecently, there’s been a push for improvement in data quality standards, such as “Datasheets for Datasets” (Gebru et al. 2021) and the explosion of features stores, model stores, and evaluation stores1.\nTakeaways\nNA (sodium) ≠ NA (not available)\nSilent deployment is important.\nThorough metadata and data quality standards are important to mitigating these kinds of issues.\n\n\n\nCohen, Joseph Paul, Tianshi Cao, Joseph D.
